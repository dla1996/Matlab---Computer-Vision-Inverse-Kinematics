TO DO:

  1: Get picture - DONE
  2: Get edges - DONE
  3: Get points of edges - DONE
  4: Convert points to image-plane/work-plane of robot. Down on table or wall - DONE
  5: Inverse kinematics of points in workspace; define constraints would need iterative solutions. Prob best to use robot toolbox.
  6: Move to solution with small extra translation due to marker.
  7: Check its current joint positions, relative to next point's positions.
  8: Pathfinding would be needed. linked lists https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_oop/example-implementing-linked-lists.html
