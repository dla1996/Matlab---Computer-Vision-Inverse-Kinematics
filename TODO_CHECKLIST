TO DO:

  1: Get picture - DONE
  2: Get edges
  3: Get points of edges
  4: Convert points to image-plane/work-plane of robot. Down on table or wall
  5: Inverse kinematics of points in workspace; define constraints would need iterative solutions. Prob best to use robot toolbox.
  6: Move to solution with small extra translation due to marker.
  7: Check its current joint positions, relative to next point's positions.
  8: It might points being drawn rather than lines.
  9: Pathfinding would be needed.
